Hi there,

I‚Äôm a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist who lives in New York by way of San Francisco.

I'm interested in cities and how to facilitate connections between the people that inhabit them. Some projects I've worked on include: üçº[Message in a Bottle](docs/projects/message-in-a-bottle), üí≠[Pillars of Reflection](docs/projects/pillars-of-reflection), üíî[The Breakup Coloring Book](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/etiennema/the-breakup-coloring-book) and üß†[Likemind](docs/projects/likemind).

At Dropbox, I developed the company's first brand architecture, established foundational principles for brand building, and worked on everything brand-related, including: naming, logos, icons, events, partnerships, guidelines, product videos, campaigns, blogs, company mission, and design strategy.

Prior to that, I was at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, where I worked on Adobe and Doritos. For Adobe, we did things like make fun of marketers (Exhibits [A](https://vimeo.com/140676834), [B](https://vimeo.com/210310989), [C](https://vimeo.com/154258525), among many) and launch a [stock photography site](https://vimeo.com/225602366).¬†For Doritos, we made a ridiculous [Superbowl Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o74gpGTK7A&feature=emb_title) but also extended the Doritos brand beyond its signature slapstick humor with efforts like [Doritos Rainbows](https://www.time.com/4038837/doritos-rainbow-chips-pride-lgbt/) and [Doritos No Choice](https://www.facebook.com/DoritosUSA/videos/10154860232226165/).

Other places I've worked include Naked Communications NY and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai; I also founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island. My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca-Cola.

In my spare time, I‚Äôm a hoops junkie, an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ, and a cyclist who somehow misses the hills of San Francisco.

If you're interested in collaborating, have space to host some art, happen to be a wealthy benefactor, or are just curious, here's some üè†[ideas that need a home](docs/projects/ideas-that-need-a-home).
