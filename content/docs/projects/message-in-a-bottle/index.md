# Thousands of strangers leave voicemails for each other. What do they say?

Message in a Bottle was an anonymous hotline that let strangers leave voicemails for each other. Each caller left a message; then they heard what the previous caller left behind.

We left hundreds of placards with the phone number in San Francisco, New York City, London, and Sao Paulo—out on the streets, in bathrooms, in parks—and over 3000 people dialed in, leaving messages that were surprising, creative, vulnerable, and often delightful.
