Tim and I built *Pillars of Reflection* as part of the [Market Street Prototyping Festival](http://marketstreetprototyping.org/), organized by San Francisco Planning and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.Â *Pillars* was a mirror installation designed to get people to stop for a moment as they walked along Market Street.Â The Pillars were the subject of many curious stares, selfies, smiles, and even a birthday celebration.
