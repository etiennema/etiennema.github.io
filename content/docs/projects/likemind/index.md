An experiment conducted over five hundred notecards, each with the message above, placed in books that have resonated with me.Â The notecards are scattered across book shops, thrift stores, and libraries in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Providence, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, and Melbourne.

To date, 23 folks have reached out to say hi.
