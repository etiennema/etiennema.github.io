Some of these projects include: Message in a Bottle, Pillars of Reflection, and The Breakup Coloring Book.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been lucky to make great work with many companies while at Dropbox, Goodby Silverstein \u0026amp; Partners, Naked Communications, and Wieden+Kennedy, including:\n  Dropbox‚Äîdeveloping the company\u0026rsquo;s first brand architecture, establishing foundational principles for brand building, and working on everything brand-related, including: naming, logos, icons, events, partnerships, guidelines, product videos, campaigns, blogs, company mission, and design strategy.\n  Adobe‚Äîmaking fun of marketers (Exhibits A , B , C , among many) and launching a stock photography site.   Doritos‚Äîgetting ridiculous at the Superbowl and extending the Doritos brand beyond its signature slapstick humor with efforts like Doritos Rainbows and Doritos No Choice.   Milwaukee Bucks‚Äîdoing the brand strategy work that began the revitalization of a 50+ year old NBA franchise deep in NBA purgatory (this was in 2013, the year they drafted an 18 year old unknown by the name of Giannis Antetokounmpo).\n  In my spare time, I‚Äôm a hoops junkie, an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ, and a cyclist who somehow misses the hills of San Francisco.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to follow my personal projects, this newsletter is the best way to do that.
