Some projects I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on include: 🍼Message in a Bottle, 💭Pillars of Reflection, 💔The Breakup Coloring Book and 🧠Likemind.\nAt Dropbox, I developed the company\u0026rsquo;s first brand architecture, established foundational principles for brand building, and worked on everything brand-related, including: naming, logos, icons, events, partnerships, guidelines, product videos, campaigns, blogs, company mission, and design strategy.\nPrior to that, I was at Goodby Silverstein \u0026amp; Partners, where I worked on Adobe and Doritos. For Adobe, we did things like make fun of marketers (Exhibits A , B , C , among many) and launch a stock photography site . For Doritos, we made a ridiculous Superbowl Commercial but also extended the Doritos brand beyond its signature slapstick humor with efforts like Doritos Rainbows and Doritos No Choice .\nOther places I\u0026rsquo;ve worked include Naked Communications NY and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai; I also founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island. My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca-Cola.\nIn my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie, an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ, and a cyclist who somehow misses the hills of San Francisco.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in collaborating, have space to host some art, happen to be a wealthy benefactor, or are just curious, here\u0026rsquo;s some 🏠ideas that need a home.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/message-in-a-bottle/","title":"Message in a Bottle","section":"Projects","content":"🍼 Message In a Bottle #  In close collaboration with Danny Witters, Tim Wei, and Han Yang Lee.\n Thousands of strangers leave voicemails for each other. What do they say? #  Message in a Bottle was an anonymous hotline that let strangers leave voicemails for each other.
