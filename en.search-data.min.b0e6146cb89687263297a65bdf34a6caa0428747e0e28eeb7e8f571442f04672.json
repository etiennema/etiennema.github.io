[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/about/","title":"About","section":"Docs","content":"Hi there!\nI’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist who lives in New York by way of San Francisco.\nI enjoy working on projects that facilitate connections between people and the cities they inhabit. Some of these projects include: Message in a Bottle, Pillars of Reflection, and The Breakup Coloring Book.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been lucky to make great work with many companies while at Dropbox, Goodby Silverstein \u0026amp; Partners, Naked Communications, and Wieden+Kennedy, including:\n  Dropbox—developing the company\u0026rsquo;s first brand architecture, establishing foundational principles for brand building, and working on everything brand-related, including: naming, logos, icons, events, partnerships, guidelines, product videos, campaigns, blogs, company mission, and design strategy.\n  Adobe—making fun of marketers (Exhibits A , B , C , among many) and launching a stock photography site.   Doritos—getting ridiculous at the Superbowl and extending the Doritos brand beyond its signature slapstick humor with efforts like Doritos Rainbows and Doritos No Choice.   Milwaukee Bucks—doing the brand strategy work that began the revitalization of a 50+ year old NBA franchise deep in NBA purgatory (this was in 2013, the year they drafted an 18 year old unknown by the name of Giannis Antetokounmpo).\n  In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie, an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ, and a cyclist who somehow misses the hills of San Francisco.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to follow my personal projects, this newsletter is the best way to do that.

Each caller left a message; then they heard what the previous caller left behind.\nWe left hundreds of placards with the phone number in San Francisco, New York City, London, and Sao Paulo—out on the streets, in bathrooms, in parks—and over 3000 people dialed in, leaving messages that were surprising, creative, vulnerable, and often delightful.\nYou can listen to all of the messages here: https://messages.city. \n       "},{"id":2,"href":"/pillars-of-reflection/","title":"Pillars of Reflection","section":"Projects","content":"💭 Pillars of Reflection #  In close collaboration with Tim Wei\n   Tim and I built Pillars of Reflection as part of the Market Street Prototyping Festival organized by San Francisco Planning and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Pillars was a mirror installation designed to get people to stop for a moment as they walked along Market Street. The Pillars were the subject of many curious stares, selfies, smiles, and even a birthday celebration.\n                              Behind the scenes, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious:\n  "},{"id":3,"href":"/the-breakup-coloring-book/","title":"The Breakup Coloring Book","section":"Projects","content":"💔 The Breakup Coloring Book #  In close collaboration with Fu Le and Leon Lin.\n The Breakup Coloring Book is filled with wise sayings from cultures all around the world—things that people say to comfort people who have just broken up.\n       Things like “there’s plenty of fish in the sea” (English) and “there are orange trees elsewhere that grow oranges” (Greek) and “don\u0026rsquo;t give up the entire forest for a single tree” (Chinese).\nEach saying is illustrated so that anyone going through a breakup can color it in and soothe their aching heart.\nThe project was funded via generous supporters on Kickstarter, where it was selected as one of the site\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Projects We Love.\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/likemind/","title":"Likemind","section":"Projects","content":"🧠 Likemind #   Who\u0026rsquo;s reading the same books as me?\n     An experiment conducted over five hundred notecards, each with the message above, placed in books that have resonated with me. The notecards are scattered across book shops, thrift stores, and libraries in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Providence, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, and Melbourne.\nTo date, 23 folks have reached out to say hi.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/ideas-that-need-a-home/","title":"Ideas that need a home","section":"Projects","content":"🏠 Ideas that need a home #   Foggy the Bonfire #  with Tim Wei, Han Yang Lee\n  The Spotlight: 60 Seconds of Fame #  with Tim Wei, Han Yang Lee  \nThe Chauncey: oncoming bike signal #  with Kenny Hsieh, Haimin Yie, Tim Wei\n  "},{"id":6,"href":"/a-personal-corner-of-the-internet/","title":"A Personal Corner of the Internet","section":"Blog","content":"I’ve been feeling like I don\u0026rsquo;t have a place on the internet anymore. It\u0026rsquo;s become a mall, homogenized by the Facebooks, Instagrams, Twitters, and YouTubes. Everything has a similar aesthetic. Everything is geared towards likes and follows.\nI miss the land of Geocities, and Xanga, and even MySpace, where pockets of the internet were weirder and more individualized. We weren’t so focused on building audiences or brands; we just made things because it was kind of amazing that we had this new canvas for expression.\nThat’s what this blog is. An attempt to stake out my personal corner of the internet. No likes, no follows, no analytics. Just a record of what I’m working on and what’s been interesting to me. And maybe it’ll be interesting to you too—no pressure though.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/second-blog-post/","title":"Second blog post","section":"Blog","content":"This is the blog post title 2. #  This is the subtitle 2 #  Blah blah\nfoo bar baz\nsubsection #  boo hoo\n"}]
