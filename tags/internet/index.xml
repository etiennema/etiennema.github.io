It&amp;rsquo;s become a mall, homogenized by the Facebooks, Instagrams, Twitters, and YouTubes. Everything has a similar aesthetic. Everything is geared towards likes and follows.
I miss the land of Geocities, and Xanga, and even MySpace, where pockets of the internet were weirder and more individualized. We weren’t so focused on building audiences or brands; we just made things because it was kind of amazing that we had this new canvas for expression.</description></item></channel></rss>
